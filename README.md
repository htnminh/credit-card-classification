## Project Description
Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.

Our approach to the task was to explore the data, do necessary data preprocessing, create machine learning models, do evaluation and then conclude the result. For the models, we used plenty of popular ones like k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Ensemble Learning, Artificial Neural Network, and Probabilistic models.
